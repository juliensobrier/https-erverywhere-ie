<h3>diStorm3 v1.0</h3>
<table width=80%><tr><td>
The goal of diStorm3 is to decode x86/AMD64 binary streams and return a structure that describes each instruction.
The structure is generic enough to describe all types of instructions and their operands.
diStorm3 doesn't supply any text representation in the returned structure, it is up to the user to translate the results into text.
The structure was designed with two key guidelines, saving memory and the possibility to represent any instruction.
The format of an x86 instruction was taken into consideration and it allowed to optimize the structure.

<b>Syntax -</b>
typedef struct {
  _OffsetType addr;
  uint8_t size;
  uint8_t flags;
  uint8_t segment;
  uint16_t opcode;
  _Operand ops[OPERANDS_NO];
  uint8_t base, scale;
  uint8_t dispSize;
  uint64_t disp;
  _Value imm;
} _DecompedInst;

<b>Members -</b>
<b>addr</b>
    Specifies the address in memory of the instruction.
<b>size</b>
    Specifies the size of the whole instruction.
<b>flags</b>
    Specifies possible cases about the instruction itself. This is a bit-field and might contain a few values together.
    If it contains equals to FLAG_NOT_DECODABLE the instruction is not decodeable
    (a few reason might cause so, lack of bytes to disassemble it, invaild instruction, invalid encoding, etc).
    Otherwise, it will indicate which prefixes were used for the instruction, such as:
    FLAG_LOCK - The instruction will access memory atomically.
    FLAG_REPNZ - The instruction is repeated as long as zero flag is clear.
    FLAG_REP - The instruction is repeated as long as zero flag is set.

    FLAG_GET_OPSIZE - Returns the DecodeType (Decode16Bits, Decode32Bits or Decode64Bits) of the effective operand size of the instruction.
    FLAG_GET_ADDRSIZE - Returns the DecodeType (Decode16Bits, Decode32Bits or Decode64Bits) of the effective address size of the instruction.
    Using the latter two macros you can determine the size of operand or address, Decode16Bits - 16 bits, Decode32Bits - 32 bits and Decode64Bits - 64 bits.
    The sizes returns by these macros take into consideration the prefixes even if they are dropped.

    NOTE - Even if an operand size prefix or an address size prefix were dropped (ignored) they are still taken into account in the flags above!
    This behavior is good if diStorm doesn't use the prefix, but the the prefix really affects the instruction and you have to take care of it on your own.
    For instance, 'db 0x66 ret' in 16 bits mode, will read an address into EIP from SP.
    diStorm doesn't know how to deal with such a combination, but for an accurate decode, you might wish to know to handle these situations.
<b>segment</b>
    Specifies the index of the segment register which the instruction uses to access memory.
    This member contains the segment override prefix only, if one exists.
    Note that if the instruction doesn't access memory and a segment override was used, it will be ignored.
<b>opcode</b>
    Specifies the index of the opcode. This index will be used to recognize an instruction.
    Note that this index is shared among all opcodes with the same mnemonic.
		E.G: MOV EAX, 0 and MOV CR0, EAX, which are certainly <i>different</i> instructions, will both have the same opcode index for 'MOV'.
    You will be able to distinguish between them only by examining the operands.
<b>ops</b>
    An array of up to 4 instructions that describe the operands of the instruction. See <a href="#_Operand">_Operand structure</a>.
<b>base</b>
    Specifies the index of the 'base' register for a <i>memory indirection</i> operand.
    Used only when there is an operand type of O_MEM.
<b>scale</b>
    Specifies the scale number of the <i>'index'</i> register only for a <i>memory indirection</i> operand.
    Used only when there is an operand type of O_MEM. Note that scale can be one of: 2, 4, 8. Scale of 1 is ignored.
<b>dispSize</b>
    Specifies the size of the 'disp' member. Despite of the fixed allocated size of the 'disp' member, this size indicates the original displacement size.
    Used only when there is an operand type of O_MEM or O_DISP.
<b>disp</b>
    Specifies the displacement value of a <i>memory indirection</i> operand. This value can be treated as signed.
    Used only when there is an operand type of O_MEM, O_SMEM or O_DISP.
<b>value</b>
    The 'value' member can be used separately for different operand types:
    O_IMM: Specifies the value of an immediate operand. This value can be treated in any size and signdness.
           The size of the immediate is found inside the specific operand whose type is O_IMM.
    O_PTR: Specifies the segment and offset of an absolute address pointer which is a part of the instruction itself.
           Use value.ptr.seg and value.ptr.off to access them correspondingly.
           The size of the ptr.off is found inside the specific operand whose type is O_PTR.
    O_PC: Specifies the relative offset to the branch target, calculated relative to the address of the current instruction.
          The size of the relative branch offset is found inside the specific operand whose type is O_PC.
          Use only the 'imm' member to access the branch offset, which might be also signed.

<b>Remarks -</b>
    Don't access members that you're not allowed to. Some of them might contain garbage data and lead to errornous decode.
    Access to members that are safe, or only to those that the 'ops' indicated that are safe.

    Before you access any member of this structure make sure the instruction is valid by comparing 'flags' with FLAG_NOT_DECODABLE.
    If the instruction isn't valid, you can find the faulting byte at imm.byte.

    If a prefix byte was dropped (ignored) it will be considered as invalid instruction, it is up to the user how to handle this situation.

    Warning - You must not depend on the values of the 'opcode' member between different versions of diStorm3.
              The _MNEMONICS and _InstructionType values might change from version to version.
              Therefore, if you want to save the opcode member to you will have to translate it to something constant, like its text.

<b>Usage Examples -</b>
    In order to print the mnemonic of an instruction use the _MNEMONICS, such as:
    print _MNEMONICS[_DecodeInst.mnemonic]

    For testing the opcode for a specific mnemonic use the _InstructionType enum. For instance, testing for flow control instructions:
    if (_DecodeInst.opcode in [I_JMP, I_CALL, I_LOOP, I_JZ, I_JNZ, ...]) A flow control instruction is found, use imm.addr...

<b>Syntax -</b>
typedef struct {
    uint8_t type; /* _OperandType */
    uint8_t size;
    uint8_t index;
} _Operand;

<b>Members -</b>
<b>type</b>
    Type is _OperandType enum:
    typedef enum { O_NONE, O_REG, O_IMM, O_IMM1, O_IMM2, O_DISP, O_SMEM, O_MEM, O_PC, O_PTR } _OperandType;
    And can be any of the specified above.

    O_NONE: Indicates there is no operand and all members of it should be ignored.
            It also implies that the following operands are empty as well as this one.
    O_REG: The 'index' member specifies the index of a register.
           All types of registers (E.G: MMX, SSE, FPU, GPR, etc) are representable by O_REG.
           The 'size' member specifies the size of the register.
    O_IMM: Indicates that the _DecodeInst.imm contains the value of the immediate, whose size is specified in the 'size' member.
    O_IMM1: Indicates that the _DecodeInst.imm.ex.i1 contains the value of the immediate, whose size is specified in the 'size' member.
    O_IMM2: Indicates that the _DecodeInst.imm.ex.i2 contains the value of the immediate, whose size is specified in the 'size' member.
    O_DISP: Indicates that the _DecodeInst.disp contains the value of the displacement of absolute memory address.
            The 'size' member specifies the bandwidth of memory access. E.G: INC <b>QWORD</b> [0x12345678], whereas size of displacement is 32 bits.
            The '_DecodeInst.dispSize' indicates the size of the displacement value itself.
    O_SMEM: (Simple memory dereference) - The 'index' member specifies the index of a register for a memory dereference.
            The 'size' member specifies the bandwidth of memory access.
            O_SMEM might also contain a displacement, refer to O_DISP.
    O_MEM: (Memory dereference) - The 'index' member specifies the index of the Index register.
           The Index register is the one that might be scaled by _DecodeInst.scale.
           The _DecodeInst.base might specify the index of a register, otherwise it is R_NONE.
           The 'size' member specifies the bandwidth of memory access.
           The O_MEM might also contain a displacement, refer to O_DISP.
    O_PC: (Program Counter) Indicates that _DecodeInst.imm contains the relative offset to the target instruction.
          The offset is calculated relative to the address of the current instruction.
          The 'size' member specifies the size of the relative branch offset of the instruction itself.
    O_PTR: Indicates that _DecodeInst.imm.ptr contain the segment-offset pair.
           The 'size' member specifies the size of the offset value.
           E.G: JMP FAR ffff:fff0.
<b>size</b>
    Specifies the size of the member the 'type' member refers to.
    E.G: For a register it will be the size of that register. For a memory dereference, it will be the size of read or write operation.
<b>index</b>
    Specifies the index of a register, used only when 'type' is O_REG, O_SMEM or O_MEM.
    This member holds any one of the registers (MMX, SSE, FPU, GPR, etc).

<b>Remarks -</b>
    The O_IMM1 and O_IMM2 types are special types used by instructions that have two immediates (E.G: ENTER),
    since there is only a one 'imm' member in the _DecodeInst shared among all potential operands, these two additional types,
    will be stored inside the 'imm' member without overriding each other.

<b>Usage Examples -</b>
    For instance, if you want to check whether a register is of FPU type:
    if ((ops[n].index &gt;= R_ST0)) &amp;&amp; ((ops[n].index &lt;= R_ST7)) This is an FPU register.

    In order to print the name of the instruction use the _REGISTERS table, such as:
    print _REGISTERS[ops[n].index]

    If you want to check for a specific register you can use the _RegisterType enum,
    which contains all registers in the specific order of the processor.
    if (ops[n].index == R_RIP) ...

<b>Syntax -</b>
typedef union {
  int8_t sbyte;
  uint8_t byte;
  int16_t sword;
  uint16_t word;
  int32_t sdword;
  uint32_t dword;
  int64_t sqword;
  uint64_t qword;
  _OffsetType addr;
  struct {
    uint16_t seg;
    uint32_t off;
  } ptr;
  struct {
    uint32_t i1;
    uint32_t i2;
  } ex;
} _Value;

<b>Members -</b>
<b>sbyte</b>, <b>sword</b>, <b>sdword</b> and <b>sqword</b>: signed integers with varying sizes to access the immediate value.
<b>byte</b>, <b>word</b>, <b>dword</b> and <b>qword</b>: unsigned integers with varying sizes to access the immediate value.
    The sizes are corresponding to 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits.
    These members are there only for ease and must be used only when the operand type is O_IMM.
    Accessing the 'qword' member will be most convenient,
    unless you need to know the size specifically and to change signedness.
<b>addr</b>
    Contains the absolute target address of a branched-type instruction, such as: CALL, JMP, etc.
    Use only when the operand type is O_PC.

    Notice the type of the 'addr' member is _OffsetType, which is dependent upon the way
    diStorm3 was compiled - whether with support for 64 bit offsets or not. If there is a support for 64 bit offsets,
    the _OffsetType is 64 bits long, otherwise 32 bits. This is supposed to be transparent to the library user.
<b>ptr</b>
    Contains the absolute target address of instructions which can branch to a 'far' address, such as: CALL FAR and JMP FAR.
    The 'seg' member contains the 16 bits segment value.
    The 'off' member contains the 16 or 32 bits offset value.
    The size of the offset is specified in the 'size' member of the operand whose type is O_PTR.
<b>ex</b>
    Contains two immediate values in 'ex.i1' and 'ex.i2'. Access 'ex.i1' when the operand type is O_IMM1.
    Access 'ex.i2' when the operand type is O_IMM2. The size of the ex.i immediate value is specified in the 'size' member of the operand.

    Note that this is unlike the above members ('byte', 'word', etc) to access the single immediate value of type O_IMM,
    in this case the 'ex' structure contains two separated 32bit values which represent two different immediates.

<hr>
<b>Undefined Size</b>
The following instructions have their size undefined, they use OT_MEM. This means you should not rely on their size, which is 0.
INVLPG, PREFETCH, PREFETCHW, PREFETCHNTA, PREFETCHT0, PREFETCHT1, PREFETCHT2, FXSAVE, FXRSTOR, LDMXCSR, STMXCSR,
CLFLUSH, BOUND, LEA, FSTENV, FSTCW, FSAVE, FSTSW, FLDENV, FLDCW, FNSTENV, FNSTCW, FRSTOR, FNSAVE, FNSTSW, LDDQU.

Note that LEA has the operand type OT_MEM as well, you might want to check for LEA specifically and handle its fake memory dereference.
<hr>
<b>Special Case Instructions</b>
JMP/CALL/LOOP -
When the JMP, CALL and LOOP instructions are used with relative offset, you have to add the size of the instruction yourself to the given offset.
Therefore the destination offset is calculated as: ii.imm + ii.size.

LOOP -
For all loop instructions you might be interested in knowing the size of the rCX register (either 16/32/64),
which is calculated according to the Effective Address size, therefore you should examine the 'flags' member for getting this,
use the macro: FLAG_GET_ADDRSIZE.

MOVS/CMPS -
Since these instructions return only the first operand; the data structures diStorm3 uses cannot represent
two memory indirection operands at the same instruction. Therefore you have to determine the second operand on your own.
To find out the right register size use the address size from the 'flags' member.
For MOVS it will be SI, ESI or RSI according to FLAG_GET_ADDRSIZE respectively.
And for CMPS it will be DI, EDI or RDI according to the FLAG_GET_ADDRSIZE respectively.
E.G: CMPS BYTE [ESI], [EDI] - size of dereference is found in ops[0].size, of course, '[ESI'] is supplied by ops[0] as well.
A segment override may be used only for the first operand.

JCXZ/JECXZ/JRCXZ -
Each of this instruction has its own opcode-id, this way you can distinguish them easily
and know the size of the counter register (CX/ECX/RCX correspondly).

PUSH -
The immediate size specifies the size of the immediate that was read from the instruction. It might be even a byte using opcode 0x6a.
To know how many bytes really were written to the stack use the 'flags' member macros to get the effective operand size.

PUSHA/POPA -
You have to know the operand size and address size in order to know whether to push AX or EAX and whether to use SP or ESP.
In order to get this information use the 'flags' member macros. PUSHA and POPA are not decodeable in 64bits.

PUSHF/POPF -
The operand size from the 'flags' member will indicate the size you have to pad the flags to push.
The address size will indicate the size of stack pointer to use.

BSWAP -
BSWAP can operate on either 32 or 64 bits. You will determine the behavior of BSWAP by the operand size from the 'flags' member.

IMUL -
The IMUL instruction has actually three forms where it gets from one up to three operands. In order to distinguish among each
form you should rely on the number of operands of the IMUL opcode-id.

RET -
The RET instruction has two variations, one that only pops the IP and another that cleans the stack.
To distinguish between them, rely on the number of operands. If it's 0, it's a simple RET.
And if it's 1 it is a RET that gets a 16bits immediate to adjust the stack pointer after popping the IP.

XLAT -
The single operand of XLAT has already the memory indirection ready to use, [rBX+AL]. rBX is determined by the effective address size.

BT/BTC/BTS/BTR -
When these instructions are used with a first operand as memory indirection, the effective address has to be extended.
diStorm doesn't return all information you need for this instructions. Because the effective address is really based
on the <i>second operand</i>, it has to be treated as well. For more information see x86 Instruction Set Architecture references.

There might be other instructions that need a special treatment, therefore you should rely on the 'flags' member to know the effective
operand size and address size and act accordingly.
